# EcoCart â€“ Sustainable Shopping Assistant

EcoCart is a web application designed to promote sustainable shopping by providing users with detailed information about eco-friendly products. The app rates products based on their eco-friendliness (materials, brand ethics, certifications, etc.) and suggests greener alternatives. It also allows users to add new products, manage the product database, and save data to a Firestore database.
